## Planned Features

Note that I work on this in my free time and mostly prioritize based on my own interests. Don't hold your breath waiting
for a feature release.

* Compilation of external tama resources - resources I've found useful made by others in the community and also links to
  their shops
* Table of alternate forms - costumes, changes, transformations, personality stages etc.
* Raisable characters from other tamas - show a table with row representing the characters (i.e. Angel, Nanos...)
* All Raisable Digimon Characters - similar to "All Raisable Tamagotchi Characters" but for Digimon
