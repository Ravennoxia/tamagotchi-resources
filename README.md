# Raven's Tamagotchi resources

This website will house resources I have created for the Tamagotchi community and links to external resources.

Currently, the only feature is table showing all raisable Tamagotchi characters across the devices. It is still being
worked on. If you find any issues, please let me know!

## Planned features

* Replacement for the Google sheet
  of [Tamagotchi versions timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQNrfPDuhpraRpG0qcQhrm-EdRcS7mM6pFkMo1Ofs9f1W9J5AKpOTKRaxrRvbKo52FSD6Xlfrl46NyI/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)
* A page that compiles various useful Tamagotchi resources from different people of the community

## Sources

* Images are sourced from [Tamagotchi wiki](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page)
* The site also links to the wiki
